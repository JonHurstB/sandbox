      <p>Dear Parents / Guardians</p>

      <p>Welcome back. I hope that you had a lovely Easter break! Following discussions with the children, this term
      Reception class are going to be looking at the theme of ‘Space’. Below, I have given details of some of the
      different activities and learning experiences that we will be offering the children. Again, please feel free to
      annotate this document and return it to me with any other ideas or suggestions for exciting activities. In
      addition, if you have any resources such as space books, puzzles, solar system models…, which you would be happy
      to lend us, please let me know! We will of course still be looking after and adding to the plants and vegetables
      that we started to grow last term – thank you for all the parents who helped supply us with a wonderful range of
      seeds and other resources! </p>

      <p>Best wishes</p>

      <p>Miss Higgins</p>
