      <h1>Anti-Bullying Policy</h1>

      <h2>What is Bullying</h2>

      <p>Bullying means that one person (or a group) is deliberately and knowingly hurting another, mentally and/or
      physically, for fun “just because they can”. This happens on repeated occasions and is not usually a “one-off”
      incident. The victim has their confidence so undermined that they allow this to continue and feel powerless to
      stop the torment.</p>

      <p>Sadly, this happens in all walks of life – for adults as well as children.</p>

      <h2>What <em>is not</em> Bullying</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>A child “falling out” with another and having a disagreement.</li>
        <li>A child bumping into another in the playground.</li>
        <li>Playing boisterously or loudly</li>
        <li>A “one-off” angry outburst.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Strategies Used</h2>

      <p>At Churchill Primary School we are very sensitive to real bullying. We have a policy and strategies in place to
      deal quickly and sensitively with both the bully and the victim.</p>

      <p>As soon as we find out about incidents of bullying:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The “Bully” and the “Victim” are listened to separately.</li>
        <li>All parties are then brought together and given the opportunity to share their views of the incident.</li>
        <li>The “Bully” and the “Victim” are set targets and report back the success of these.</li>
        <li>Incidents may be shared with the whole class and when necessary, discussion could take place in order to
        support class members.</li>
        <li>If these strategies are not successful, professional advice is sought. This could include assertiveness
        training or counseling.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>At Churchill Primary we teach children skills to enable them to live happily together throughout their lives.</p>
