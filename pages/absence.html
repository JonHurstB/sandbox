      <h1>Absence</h1>

      <p>Though we do not encourage absence during term time, we recognise that there are occasions when it is simply
      unavoidable. Up to 10 days per academic year are permitted by the DfES, this time <strong>includes</strong> any
      days taken to cover illness (or indeed any other reason).</p>

      <p>If you wish to take your child out of school (for example to go on holiday during term time), please complete
      an absence request form from the general office. Each such application will be considered by the Head Teacher, and
      if approved, a copy will be returned to you. Note that, authorisation is not guaranteed, and a child absent
      without authorisation will normally be referred to the education authority.</p>
