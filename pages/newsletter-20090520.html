      <h2>A message from Governors</h2>

      <p>One of the questions on the parent questionnaire was about the role of Governors. We have booked a slot in the
      next letter to give you that information!</p>

      <p>At our last meeting we discussed a number of areas of school life. Mrs Lloyd gave a presentation on the trips
      and visits that pupils take part in to enrich their curriculum. Governors then had an opportunity to look around
      the classrooms and were very impressed by the bright and inspirational displays and the quality of the children's
      work. A huge thank you must go to all the staff for making out school such a very special place for children.</p>
