      <h1>Behaviour Policy</h1> 

      <p>This policy reflects the Church of England foundation and ethos of the school (and has been formally adopted by
      the Governing Body and staff).</p>

      <h2>Rationale</h2>

      <p>We encourage children to take responsibility for their own actions, developing self-discipline, respect for
      themselves, others and the environment.  This creates a happy, caring school, which enables effective teaching and
      learning to take place.</p>

      <h2>Aims of the Policy</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>School rules are shared and understood by all members of the school community and are
        <strong>consistently</strong> upheld.</li>
        <li>Emphasis is to be placed on positive behaviour.</li>
        <li>Children are encouraged to take responsibility for their own behaviour, to ensure they are sensible,
        trustworthy and polite.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implementation/Practice</h2>

      <p>Our school rules:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I will treat everyone as I would like them to treat me.</li>
        <li>This is my school. I will look after everything in and around it.</li>
        <li>I will try to do my best work and let others do the same.</li>
        <li>I will follow instructions first time.</li>
        <li>I will move sensibly and safely around the school and always walk when inside.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acknowledgments/Rewards</h2>
      
      <p>We encourage positive behaviour by the use of: e.g.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verbal greetings and eye contact </li>
        <li>Peer group praise </li>
        <li>Giving additional attention </li>
        <li>Head Teacher’s praise </li>
        <li>Comments in books </li>
        <li>Praise in Assembly </li>
        <li>Stickers/stampers </li>
        <li>Positive comments board </li>
        <li>Smiles/nods </li>
        <li>Tone of voice </li>
        <li>Sharing jokes </li>
        <li>Displaying work </li>
        <li>Special jobs </li>
        <li>Celebration assemblies </li>
        <li>Role models may be used, i.e. behaviour of pupils, etc. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Class Rewards </h2> 

      <p>Individual Class Teachers will develop their own rewards system for classes. This may sometimes involve sending
      the children to the Head for a sticker or notifying parents of success, allowing the children extra playtime or
      helping out in a pleasant task. Classes will celebrate and share success during Friday service. </p>

      <h2>If Rules are Broken in Class:</h2>

      <p>Staff will make a professional decision and adopt the most appropriate strategies to deal with the situation
      (in the classroom):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use of spoken warning, clearly explaining what behaviour is unacceptable and the positive outcomes of
        maintaining the expected behaviour.</li>
        <li>Moved within class </li>
        <li>Name on board in line with individual class rules </li>
        <li>Time out in another class (recorded in Class Behaviour Book) </li>
        <li>Break time missed – walk around with teacher on duty or sit in isolation</li>
        <li>Written reflection of behaviour. Apologies made as appropriate</li>
        <li>Contact parents, use of positive letters </li>
        <li>Repeated/serious unacceptable behaviour immediately referred to Head</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If Rules are Broken at Lunchtimes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pupil sent to stand by wall until SMSA returns and tells the child they may leave</li>
        <li>Black card sent to office for serious problems and member of SMT will go out onto playground</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Unacceptable behaviour will be referred to class teacher and where appropriate, parents. Parents should be
      contacted as soon as possible after unacceptable behaviour so an early solution can be
      effected. <strong>Consistently</strong> unacceptable behaviour will be referred to Head/Parents and shared with
      staff as appropriate. Serious incidents will be referred to Head and Parents. As a last resort a temporary
      exclusion may be enforced and the Governors will be informed.</p>

      <h2>Monitoring</h2>

      <p>Approaches to discipline and the effectiveness of the policy will be monitored in the following ways:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>10-minute slot at the beginning of staff meeting. </li>
        <li>Monitor class behaviour book and alert parents as appropriate. </li>
        <li>Feedback at LSA and SMSA meetings. </li>
        <li>General ambience/atmosphere/visitor comments. </li>
        <li>Governors’ visits. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Every child has different needs and our policy allows for flexibility. Some children have individual behaviour
      plans. Restraint may be used – it is an act of care, not punishment. A record will be kept and parents informed.</p>
