      <h1>Our Mission</h1>

      <p>We aim to ensure that the children in our school are provided with high quality learning experiences. Our
      Teaching and Learning Policy guides what children do, what teachers do and the school organisations that create an
      effective and well-managed learning environment.</p>
<!--todo: this paragraph doesn't make sense-->
      <p>Our school mission is:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>To inspire a love of learning within a Christian community, promoting tolerance, creativity and a zest for
        life.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Children at our school receive the very best education that can be offered. We provide a happy, secure and
      stimulating environment where children are supported. Positive attitude encourages then to develop their
      confidence, to strive ahead, unafraid to make mistakes. We work to ensure that pupils develop their full potential
      all areas of their school lives. We provide opportunities for children to work independently with self-discipline
      and self respect.</p>

      <h2>How we achieve it</h2>

      <p>In order to help us achieve our aims, we provide children with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> a happy, secure and stimulating environment</li>
        <li> a vibrant partnership between school, staff, governors, home and our wider community</li>
        <li> high, but realistic, expectations to encourage success by offering challenge and support where necessary</li>
        <li> opportunities for quiet reflection and undisturbed calm, as well as lively engagement in the curriculum</li>
        <li> a variety of teaching strategies to recognise different learning styles</li>
        <li> rich, varied and quality resources</li>
        <li> opportunities for varied extra-curricular activities</li>
        <li> involvement in the school's development, listening to their opinions and needs</li>
      </ul>

      <p> We demonstrate our commitment to high achievement and learning within our whole school community through:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> valuing staff development as a means for continuous improvement</li>
        <li> collaborative work to achieve common goals</li>
        <li> becoming an "Investor in People"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a voluntary controlled school, we place a strong emphasis on the development of Christian attitudes of
      understanding, caring and tolerance towards all members of the community. We treat children with quiet respect as
      individuals and listen to their needs and opinions. We encourage our children to be responsive, alert and
      enthusiastic. We value extra curricula activities as an opportunity for children to extend skills in smaller
      informal groups. We positively encourage a vibrant partnership between parents, teachers, governors and the local
      community as we believe that we are working together as a team with the common goal of providing the best
      education for every child and the best society for all our futures.</p>
