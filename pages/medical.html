      <h1>Medical</h1>

      <h2>Illness</h2>

      <p>If your child is ill and will not be attending school, please let us know as soon as possible on the first day
      of absence by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sending a note with an older sibling</li>
        <li>Telephoning the office on 01934 852446 (answerphone before 08:30)</li>
        <li>Sending and email to absence@churchill-pri.n-somerset.sch.uk</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We will attempt to contact you if your child is not in school and we have not had a reason for absence. It is
      therefore essential that we have a current number on which to contact you.</p>

      <p>If a child is absent on one day we will assume he or she continues to be absent for the same reason on any
      subsequent days.</p>

      <h2>Medical conditions</h2>

      <p>Please notify us of any medical conditions, permanent or temporary, which may affect your child in school
      e.g. asthma, allergies.</p>

      <h2>Allergies</h2>
      
      <p>Please let us know if a child has, or develops any allergies/food intolerance. This will allow us to plan any
      changes that may be required to activities in school (e.g. cooking) and, where necessary, inform other parents in
      order that lunch box contents may be adjusted accordingly.</p>

      <h2>Medication</h2>

      <p>We can administer prescribed medications, but will require written consent. For conditions such as asthma, we
      recommend that a spare inhaler (and preferably a spacer as well) are kept in the school office. Similarly, EpiPens
      may be administered in school, but should not be carried by the pupils. If you have any concerns or queries,
      please do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
