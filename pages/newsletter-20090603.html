      <h1>Newsletter - 3rd June 2009</h1>

      <p>Welcome back!  I trust you are all refreshed and ready for our busy summer term.  I hope you all made the most
      of the glorious weather we had during the week.  We have a little reminder towards the end of the school letter
      regarding sun cream and sun hats; please take time to read these very important notes.</p>

      <p><strong>Important Note</strong>: There will be no choir after school on Friday 5th June</p>

      <h2>Hot off the press ... Artsmark Gold</h2>

      <p>It is with the greatest pleasure and pride that I can announce that the school has been awarded from the Arts
      Council the Artsmark Gold award. This represents the highest level of achievement a school can attain in Arts
      education and it recognises outstanding provision made in Art, Dance, Drama and Music across the school, from PTA
      art exhibitions to maypole dancing, taking part in school productions to learning songs in 'Big Sing'.  It
      reflects the hard work by the whole school community in the wider arts.</p>

      <p>Each application goes through a rigorous five-step assessment process which includes a visit to the school to
      ensure that the strict criteria for Artsmark have been met. It can be achieved at three levels: Artsmark, Artsmark
      Silver and Artsmark Gold so we are especially delighted with this judgement!</p>

      <p>I should like to thank the staff, in particular, for their hard work and enthusiasm in the many arts
      opportunities they offer the children that has led to the school receiving this prestigious award.</p>

      <h2>School Worship Theme</h2>

      <p>This term our first theme will be "helping".</p>

      <h2>Everyone - Please help Y1</h2>

      <p>If you have any empty clear 2lt plastic bottles to donate we would love to receive them so that we can continue
      with the construction of our eco-friendly greenhouse - at the moment it's going to be very small!</p>

      <h2>Website</h2>

      <p>Have you seen our fantastic newly designed school website?  If not have a look at <a
      href="http://www.churchill-pri.n-somerset.sch.uk">www.churchill-pri.n-somerset.sch.uk</a>.  Let us know what you
      think.</p>

      <h2>Staff news</h2>

      <p>Miss Lewis has decided to retire at the end of this year. She has worked in the school for thirteen years and
      has been teaching for 37! As well as over 400 children who have been in her classes here at Churchill she has
      worked with many more with her multiple roles in school including working with parents in the library and the
      ever-popular French Café. She is going to be greatly missed!</p>
	
      <p>We will, of course, be wanting to send her off in style. If anyone would like to contribute to a leaving
      present for Miss Lewis, please send it in a named envelope to the office marked 'Retirement'.</p>

      <h2>Paperless school</h2>

      <p>Thursday 4th June is 'Green Day'.  This is an incentive to encourage us all to think about the paper we use and
      if we could use less.  We would like to reduce the amount of paper we send home and our first step is to see if we
      can get 100% of the school having the school letter sent by email.  Please complete the slip at the bottom of the
      letter and return to school as soon as possible - we could have this up and running by next week if you all reply
      before the end of the week! Let's try!</p>

      <h2>Well done</h2>

      <h2>Reminders</h2>

      <h3>Sun cream</h3>

      <p>We have previously asked the children to bring in sun cream to be put on during the school day.  There are now
      products that last 12 hours or more so we are requesting that sun cream be applied before your child comes to
      school and we would prefer no creams to be brought into school during the warm weather.</p>

      <h3>Sunhats</h3>

      <p>Children spend almost an hour outside each day; latest health advice encourages children to wear a sunhat.
      Please ensure hats are clearly marked with your child's name and preferably class.  We have limited shady areas in
      school so sun protection is vital.  Please try to leave a sunhat in your child's drawer so that they have one in
      school every day.</p>
