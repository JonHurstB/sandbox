     <h1>Welcome</h1>
 
      <p>We are a C.E.V.C primary school, catering for children between the ages of 4 and 11. We are located in the West
      Country, in beautiful countryside at the foot of the Mendip Hills, and are maintained by North Somerset
      Council. Our head teacher's name is Mrs Tighe.</p>

      <p>There are approximately 200 pupils on roll, most living within the community. The majority of pupils are
      expected to continue their education at <a href="http://www.churchill.n-somerset.sch.uk/">Churchill Community
      School</a> (comprehensive).</p>

      <p>Please stay a while and explore our site, many of our pupils have worked very hard to contribute to it and
      would be delighted to receive any feedback</p>
