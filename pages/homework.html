      <h1>Homework</h1>

      <p>Many parents ask us how much homework their children should be doing. Though we can’t give detailed
      information on a week by week, subject by subject basis, this page gives an indication of the amount of time we
      would expect a child to spend on their homework, as well as the general topic areas this work would normally
      cover.</p>

      <p>The aim of homework is to instill a sense of more self-guided study, and is not normally used to catch up on
      work which should have been completed in class. The last thing we would want to do is deter our pupils from
      developing a love of learning by enforcing an arduous homework schedule. If the amount of time your child spends
      on their homework is significantly different from the guidance given here, please do contact your child's class
      teacher.</p>

      <h2>Key Stage 1</h2>

      <p>For children in classes R, 1 and 2, homework would normally be the exception rather than the rule,
      though we do encourage shared reading time (see below)</p>

      <p>Children in years 3 and 4 should spend 30 minutes per school day working at home. This time should be spent as
      follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reading - 15 minutes (Recommended books - Year 3 / Year 4)</li>
        <li>learning spellings - 5 minutes</li>
        <li>learning tables - 5 minutes</li>
        <li>other work set each week - 5 minutes. This could be collecting or drawing pictures, maths sheets, language
        activities, puzzles or learning work for tests.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition, parents are encouraged to read to (or with) their children on a daily basis. These activities
      obviously need to be fitted into your family routine and allow for children to attend clubs after school. The
      activities do not all need to be done in one 30 minute session.</p>

      <p>Your child will have a homework diary which outlines the week's homework. Homework is given out on a Monday and
      returned the following Monday except for spellings and times tables which are tested on a Thursday or Friday. It
      is important that parents sign the homework book to indicate that they have seen the homework and it has been
      completed. Please feel free to add your own comments in the homework books. If a piece of work is too difficult,
      too easy, or too confusing this is often the first way we find out!</p>

      <h2>Key Stage 2</h2>

      <p>As well as daily practice in tables, spellings and reading, students will be set additional tasks. These range
      from personal research, specific subject sheets to the occasional completion of unfinished work. Whenever
      possible, as least two days notice will be given for this work in an attempt to improve personal organisation
      skills! All of this will aid secondary school transfer.</p>

      <p>Every child is given a new homework diary each year. The diary should be in school every day. It would be a
      great help if parents could check this diary daily and sign it weekly (to be handed in on a Monday
      morning). Hopefully this will act as a channel of communication and if any problems completing homework within the
      time limit arise, please let us know.</p>

      <p>Children will need to use a range of sources such as library books, computers and interviews to compile notes
      which should then be written up in their own words. If you don’t have a computer at home, don’t worry; we
      structure all our homework so that work can be completed without the need for a computer at home.</p>
