      <h1>Homework Policy</h1> 

      <p>This policy reflects the Church of England foundation and ethos of our school and has been formally adopted by
      the Governing body and staff</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Homework</h2>
 
    <ul>
      <li>to develop a home/school partnership;</li>
      <li>to consolidate and reinforce work in school; </li>
      <li>to foster independent, enthusiastic learners and prepare children for the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Type and Amounts of Homework</h2> 

    <p>Numeracy and Literacy form the core focus of our homework with additional subject areas being covered.  At the
    beginning and end of each term children may be given reduced amounts of homework. Pupils who work in special groups
    may have additional homework.</p>

    <h2>Foundation /KS1</h2>

    <p>For children in Foundation / KS1 homework will largely consist of regular reading with parents and carers and
    spellings where appropriate for year 1 and 2</p>

    <h2>KS2 </h2>

    <p>Years 3/4/5 and 6 will be set regular Literacy and Numeracy homework. In addition, older children may be given
    homework which involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>finding out information;</li>
      <li>reading in preparation for lessons;</li> 
      <li>preparing oral presentations; </li>
      <li>written assignments. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Homework will be appropriately differentiated to meet the needs of the children.</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Responsibilities for Homework</h2> 

    <p>The class teacher is responsible for setting regular homework and it will be marked in a variety of ways. It is
    the child's responsibility to return it and it is the parents’/carers’ responsibility to provide a peaceful and
    suitable working environment. Parents are responsible for informing the teacher if there are any problems.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring</h2> 
    
    <table>
      <tr><th>KS1</th><td>As reading is the main focus in KS1, the Reading Diary is used as a record of books which are
      read and for parents comments. </td></tr>
      <tr><th>KS2</th><td>A Homework Diary may be used to give instructions for the forthcoming work.</td></tr>
