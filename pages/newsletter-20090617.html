        <h1>Newsletter - 17th June 2009</h1>

        <p>The children are enjoying a very busy Summer Term with some exciting activities planned for the remaining
        five weeks.</p>
 
        <p>Today we had our class photos taken.  In the last week, Year 5 had a wonderful residential trip to Folly Farm
        and Year 1 enjoyed a fun workshop from Mr Price the Morris Dancer.  Forthcoming activities include the Year 6
        visit to Wells Cathedral and Year 2 will be running a French Café on Thursday 25th June.  Key Stage 1 can bring
        their teddy bears into school on Monday 22nd June to celebrate Paddington Bear’s birthday!</p>
 
        <p>We would like to thank Mrs Blannin, who spoke to all the children about the importance of drinking water
        throughout the day for our health and also our brain power!  Please help your children by sending in a named
        water bottle each day.</p>
 
        <h2>Wrong Trousers Day</h2>
 
        <p>Next Friday, 26th June, is “Wrong Trousers Day”.  For a small donation the children may wear alternative
        trousers – anything goes!</p>
 
        <h2>Raffle Tickets</h2>
 
        <p>PTA Raffle tickets were sent home yesterday.  Please do your best to sell as many as you can and return the
        stubs and money to your child’s class teacher in a marked envelope as soon as possible.  If you would like more
        tickets to sell, these are available in the school office.</p>
 
        <h2>School Sports Day</h2>
 
        <p>Our school Sports Day is this Friday, 19th June, starting at 1.15 p.m.  All parents are welcome to attend
        this very enjoyable event.  If any parents are available to help, please let your child’s class teacher know –
        the more the merrier!!  It is especially important that your child has their sun hat and water bottle during the
        afternoon.</p>
 
        <h2>Tea At Three</h2>
 
        <p>Year 3 are hosting their Tea at Three event on 19th June.  Come and enjoy a cake and a cuppa after Sports
        Day!  Although it is Year 3’s turn to organise Tea at Three, all funds raised are pooled and shared equally
        between classes.  On a busy day like Sports Day, all extra contributions of cakes and help from other classes
        would be gratefully received!  There will also be a second hand uniform sale taking place at this event.</p>
 
        <p>Year 6 will be hosting Tea at Three on Friday July 3rd.  They are busy trying to raise money for their trip
        to London at the end of term.  At their Tea at Three there will also be a “nearly new” toy sale – all
        contributions will be gratefully received!</p>
