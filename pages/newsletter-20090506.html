      <h1>Newsletter - 6th May 2009</h1>

      <p>Another busy week in school! We had a delightful presentation of May Pole dancing by Class 1 on May Morning and
      the children enjoyed learning about this ancient tradition with Mrs Strawbridge.</p>

      <p>Although we are looking forward to the warmer weather of summer, please remember to send your child with a
      raincoat; at playtimes we encourage children to have fresh air even in drizzle!</p>

      <h2>School Certificates</h2>

      <p>As promised last week we have a double dose of school certificates this week and a special mention for Sasha
      Warbutton-Clothier for her certificate on 3rd April.</p>
