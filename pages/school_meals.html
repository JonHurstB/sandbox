      <h1>School Meals</h1>

      <p>Our school has its own kitchen and meals are available under the arrangements made by North Somerset Council.
      The current charges are £10 per week. We ask that payment is made in advance at the beginning of each term. The
      last school newsletter of each term details the charges for the next complete term. Please contact the office to
      let us know of any alterations to a child’s normal pattern of meals.</p>

      <p>Children may have a school meal or bring a packed lunch. For those bringing packed lunch, we would ask that no
      pressurised cans of fizzy drink and no glass containers or bottles are included.</p>
