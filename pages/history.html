      <p>It seems likely that the first primary school in Churchill was next to what is now the Winston Manor Hotel. In
      1825, the school moved to new premises a few hundred metres away. A school hall, library and extra classrooms were
      added in 1840 followed by further additions in various styles until the 1950s. During the 1960s, temporary
      classrooms were erected in the playground which served until the end of the century</p>

      <p>After many years of lobbying, and several false starts, plans for the brand new school were finally approved at
      the end of 1999. Construction began in early 2000 and the building was ready for occupation in November 2001. We
      feel very proud to have such a wonderfully spacious and well equipped building for our school, though we do still
      have fond memories of our old home just up the road.</p>

      <p>In addition to the new building, we are fortunate to have many modern teaching aids including an interactive
      whiteboard in every classroom, I.C.T. provision in all classrooms, a well stocked library and a multi-media
      equipped hall. We also have an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) who raise valuable funds for the school and
      foster good relationships with the wider community.</p>
