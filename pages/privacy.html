      <p>This page details our use of personal information that we collect when you use this Web site.</p>

      <h2>Use of Information</h2>

      <p>When you supply any personal information to us using the web site at churchill-pri.n-somerset.sch.uk (e.g. In
      response to a survey, leaving a message on our guest pages, or entering details into an online form) we have legal
      obligations towards you in the way we use those data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must
      explain how we will use it and we must tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else.</p>

      <p>In general, any information you provide to us via this web site will only be used within the school and by its

      if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to our web site, we can use
      whatever information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant
      third parties such as your school, employer, e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the
      content.</p>

      <p>Any personal information that you provide to us using this web site will only be stored on our systems for as
      long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met.</p>

      <h2>Access to your personal data</h2>

      <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies
      corrected. We are permitted to make a small charge to cover our expenses in servicing such requests. The current
      charge is Â£10. Please address requests to:</p>
