        <h1>Newsletter - 10th June 2009</h1>
 
        <h2>School Worship Theme</h2>
 
        <p>This week our theme for school worship is “speaking out”.</p>
 
        <h2>Everyone- Please help Y1 – We still need more!</h2>
 
        <p>If you have any empty clear 2lt plastic bottles to donate we would love to receive them so that we can
        continue with the construction of our eco-friendly greenhouse – we are currently about ½ way built!  We also
        need 5ft cane poles and if you have any you could spare please bring them into school.</p>
 
        <h2>ERIC</h2>
 
        <p>This week is ERIC week which stands for Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence.  Most
        children wet the bed at one time or another but if you have any concerns or would like further information the
        number to call is 0845 3708008 or visit eric.org.uk.  We will be having a service this week during school time
        to talk about staying healthy and drinking lots of water.</p>

        <h2>Cluster Sports</h2>
 
        <p>Many thanks to Miss Higgins for co-ordinating this wonderful event.  The rain held off and the children had a
        lovely day.</p>

        <h2>Strawberry Line</h2>
 
        <p>There is an “Evening Fun Ride” on Tuesday 16th June starting at 6.00pm; if you would like further details
        call 01934 733762 or email davidparkin@uwclub.net.  This is to celebrate Bike Week and is being run in
        conjunction with Sustrans.  There is a poster with more details displayed in the school foyer.</p>
        
        <h2>School Lunches</h2>
 
        <p>As at last week dinner money is £74.10 to take you to the end of term.</p>
 
        <h2>Reminders</h2>
 
        <p>Although the weather has not been that glorious over the last week the children still need to bring in
        sunhats every day and apply sun cream when necessary before they leave home in the morning.  I hope you don’t
        mind me keep mentioning this but it really is very important to protect ourselves from possible sun damage and
        the earlier we start the better it is. </p>
