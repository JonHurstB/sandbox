      <h1>Newsletter - 13th May 2009</h1>

      <p>We are all looking forward to Reception class's T@3 on Friday which will be raising funds towards their summer
      trip. Then on Saturday we hope to see lots of you at the PTA car boot sale setting up at 10:00am and starting to
      sell at 11:00am. Lots to buy from garden plants to Marks &amp; Sparks clothes and bacon butties and tea to enjoy.</p>


      <h2>School Worship Theme</h2>

      <p>Apologies, it has been a while since I have updated you; for the last week of this term our theme will be the
      "importance of truth in our lives".</p>

      <h2>School Certificates</h2>
      
      <p>School certificates were awarded this week to:</p>

      <table>
        <tr><td>Y2</td><td>Harry Ford</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Y3</td><td>Lailah Knight</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Y5</td><td>Elsa Mendl</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Y6</td><td>Daniel Giannetto and Tom Guy</td></tr>
      </table>

    <p>Well done to all these children who consistently work hard and are a delight to have in school.</p>

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    
    <p>Football players of the week are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daniel Casling</li>
      <li>Harrison Stevens</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Do you park considerately?</h2>
    
    <p>We have been approached by some of our neighbours about parents' parking. Please make sure you do not park in an
    inconsiderate manner or block anyone's driveway. Perhaps as the weather improves(!) you could think about parking in
    the Stag and Hounds car park and walking the rest of the way to school.</p>

    <h2>Parents' Questionnaire</h2>
    
    <p>We have had a very small number of questionnaires returned this year so I am working on the assumption that most
    people are happy!</p>

    <p>An issue was raised by some parents about the use of inappropriate language. As a staff we always reprimand
    children we hear swearing - it is not acceptable in school! Please work with us to encourage your children to think
    carefully about the language that they use.</p>

    <h2>Shoeless Children</h2>

    <p>Can you help to raise money for girls in Africa to buy shoes? In order for them to be able to go to school they
    must wear shoes. One pair of shoes only costs Â£7.00. Some of the children in Class 3 are collecting money for this
    worthy cause and are inviting other class mates to earn money for doing jobs at home. Any donations please bring to
    the office by the 18th May with the slip below. Thank you.</p>

    <h2>Reminders</h2>

    <h3>Tell the teacher</h3>

    <p>If you need to take your child out of school during the school day please ensure that you have either sent in a
    written note or spoken to the class teacher <strong>before</strong> you take them out. Please remember to sign your
    child out on the lists held in the school foyer before you leave the school premises and sign them back in when you
    return them.</p>

    <h3>School Website</h3>

    <p>Thank you to the two parents who have already started updating our school website. It will be amazing when it is
    finished. Do you have any suggestions for our re-vamped site? If so, please send them in to the school office. Thank
    you.</p>
